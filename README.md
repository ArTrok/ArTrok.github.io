# About my portfolio

It is a project using the majority of my knowledge
with JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, TailwindCSS and Node.

# Deployed application
You check my portfolio running on vercel in the link below:
https://artrok-portfolio.vercel.app/

# Running application locally 

I used Linux to develop this portfolio, so I recommend you
do the same (there should be no problem to use other OS).

All you have to do is to clone the repository with:
* `git clone https://github.com/ArTrok/ArTrok.github.io.git`

Run the command: 
* `npm install`

and start application with:
* `npm start`
